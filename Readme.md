# ClearFood

ClearFood is a command-line application that simulates a virtual food delivery system. It allows users to register, rate restaurants, place orders, and view order history. The application uses an in-memory database and does not include a graphical user interface.

## Functional Requirements

### Register Restaurant

```python
Register_restaurant(restaurant_name, list of serviceable pin-codes, food item name, food item price, initial quantity)
```

- Restaurant owners can register their restaurants with specific parameters.
- They can increase the quantity of a food item using `update_quantity(restaurant name, quantity to Add)`.

### User Interaction

```python
rate_restaurant(restaurant name, rating, comment)  # comment optional
```

- Users can rate any registered restaurant on a scale of 1 (Lowest) to 5 (Highest) with an optional comment.

### Listing and Ordering

```python
show_restaurant(rating/price)  # Based on rating or price
place_order(restaurant name, quantity)
```

- Users can view a list of serviceable restaurants with food item names and prices in descending order based on either rating or price.
- Users can place an order from any restaurant with a specified quantity.

### Order History

```python
order_history(user)
```

- For a given user, retrieve the order history.

## Sample Flow

```python
# User Registration
register_user("Pralove", "M", "phoneNumber-1", "HSR")
register_user("Nitesh", "M", "phoneNumber-2", "BTM")
register_user("Vatsal", "M", "phoneNumber-3", "BTM")
login_user("phoneNumber-1")

# Restaurant Registration
register_restaurant("Food Court-1", "BTSIM/HSR", "NI Thali", 100, 5)
register_restaurant("Food Court-2", "BTM/pincode-2", "Burger", 120, 3)
register_restaurant("Food Court-3", "HSR", "SI Thali", 150, 1)

# User Interactions
login_user("phoneNumber-2")
show_restaurant("Price")  # Output: Food Court-2, Burger | Food Court-1, NI Thali
place_order("Food Court-1", 2)  # Output: Order Placed Successfully.
place_order("Food Court-2", 7)  # Output: Cannot place order

rate_restaurant("Food Court-2", 3, "Good Food")
rate_restaurant("Food Court-1", 5, "Nice Food")
show_restaurant("rating")  # Output: Food Court-1, NI Thali | Food Court-2, Burger

login_user("phoneNumber-1")
update_quantity("Food Court-2", 5)  # Output: Food Court-2, BTM, Burger - 8
update_location("Food Court-2", "BTM/HSR")  # Output: Food Court-2, "BTM/HSR", Burger - 8
```

## Note

- The application uses an in-memory database.
- There is no graphical user interface.
- A driver class can be used to simulate all the operations.
